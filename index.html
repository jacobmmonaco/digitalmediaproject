        <p>
          This website was created by Jacob Monaco for HIST 110 at San Diego
          Miramar College (Spring 2025). It is a digital history project that
          explores how nuclear weapons transformed military strategy after 1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is based on the thesis that nuclear weapons shifted
          global strategy from conventional warfare to a doctrine centered on
          <strong>deterrence</strong>, <strong>strategic posturing</strong>, and
          <strong>diplomacy</strong>. Each section focuses on one of these key
          transformations and includes information from primary and secondary
          sources.

      <!-- INTRODUCING THE BOMB -->
      <section id="introducing-bomb" class="split-section">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>WWII Firebombings & Introducing the Bomb</h2>
          <p>
            The race to develop the atomic bomb began between the Allies and the
            Nazis. In the earlier stages of World War II, scientists including
            Albert Einstein feared that Nazi Germany was making plans to develop
            a nuclear weapon. This led to the U.S. initiating the Manhattan
            Project to develop one first, bringing the smartest scientists in
            the world together leading to the first successful detonation of an
            atomic bomb by the United States in 1945.
          </p>
          <p>
            The destruction unleashed by these new weapons was like nothing
            before. But to understand why they changed the nature of war, it
            helps to compare them to the most destructive conventional tactic of
            the time: the Tokyo firebombings. During that assault, hundreds of
            American B-29 bombers dropped explosives that turned Tokyo into a
            firestorm, killing roughly 100,000 people in a single night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just months later, a single atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima
            instantly killed 70,000 people and over 140,000 by year’s end. Yet
            Hiroshima was a much smaller city than Tokyo. With a population of
            345,000 compared to Tokyo’s 6.7 million, the bomb’s potential for
            destruction was immensely greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            The atomic bomb revolutionized military strategy. Unlike
            conventional bombings, which required hundreds of planes and hours
            of destruction, the bomb achieved devastation with one aircraft and
            one payload. It wasn’t just a weapon it was a new threat to all
            existing life on the planet.

      <!-- BRINKMANSHIP -->
      <section id="brinkmanship" class="split-section">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Brinkmanship and the Edge of War</h2>

          <p>
            As the Cold War escalated, nuclear weapons were no longer viewed as
            tools of warfare, but as symbols of power. Both the United States
            and Soviet Union built massive nuclear arsenals and used them as
            leverage. This strategy of brinkmanship, where each side pursued
            immensely dangerous strategy to the edge of nuclear war, defined
            global conflict during the middle of the 20th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most dangerous example came in October 1962: the Cuban Missile
            Crisis. When U.S. intelligence confirmed that the Soviet Union was
            installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, capable of striking nearly
            every major city in the U.S. within minutes, President John F.
            Kennedy addressed the nation. He described the act as “a
            deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo”
            and demanded immediate removal of the missiles. Upon refusal, the
            U.S. initiated a naval blockade of Cuba, and military forces reached
            a level of nuclear readiness higher than ever before or since. The
            world held its breath as two superpowers stood on the brink of
            nuclear war.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, diplomacy prevailed: the Soviets agreed to remove the
            missiles from Cuba in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade the
            island, and a secret agreement to remove American missiles from
            Turkey. No weapons were fired, yet the threat of mutual destruction
            forced both sides to back down.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just two years earlier, the Soviet Union conducted the most powerful
            nuclear test in history: Tsar Bomba. With a yield over 3,000 times
            greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, it was more
            demonstration of power than weapon. A witness described it as "it
            seemed to suck the whole Earth into it."
          </p>

          <p>
            Brinkmanship showed that nuclear weapons were no longer actually
            meant to be used, they were meant to be seen, feared, and negotiated
            with. War strategy shifted from battles to brinkmanship, with the
            threat of total annihilation always hovering in the background.

      <!-- DIPLOMACY -->
      <section id="diplomacy">
        <h2>Diplomacy and Arms Control</h2>

        <p>
          As the world dealt with the realization of the power of nuclear
          weapons, nations began to prioritize diplomacy over warfare. One of
          the earliest of these efforts came in 1953, when President Dwight D.
          Eisenhower delivered his “Atoms for Peace” speech at the United
          Nations. He proposed ideas of sharing nuclear technology for peaceful
          purposes, hoping to shift the global narrative of the power of nuclear
          energy all together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside the U.S., classified documents like NSC-68 argued that military
          strength alone wasn’t enough. To prevent nuclear war, America needed
          to project economic and political strength while maintaining a
          military edge. This thinking shaped Cold War diplomacy and led to key
          arms control efforts in the decades that followed.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most significant breakthroughs came in 1987, when President
          Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the
          Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. For the first time,
          two superpowers agreed to eliminate an entire category of nuclear
          missiles. The treaty marked a shift from preparing to fight nuclear
          wars to preventing them altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
          But diplomacy hasn’t always come from treaties or world leaders. In
          1962, during the peak of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a single man aboard
          a Soviet submarine may have saved the world. As U.S. ships dropped
          warning charges to force the sub to surface, Captain Valentin Savitsky
          gave the order to launch a nuclear torpedo. He needed unanimous
          approval from two other officers. One said yes, but the other, Vasili
          Arkhipov, said no. His refusal stopped a potential nuclear war. For a
          moment, the fate of the world depended on one man’s restraint.
        </p>

        <p>
          These efforts, both formal and personal, helped bring global nuclear
          stockpiles down from their peak of over 70,000 warheads in 1986 to
          about 12,100 today. However, today’s arsenals are far more advanced,
          and thousands of warheads remain on hair-trigger alert. The world has
          moved closer to peace—but the shadow of nuclear war has never fully
          disappeared.

              In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to eliminate all
              intermediate-range nuclear missiles, marking one of the most
              successful arms control agreements in history.

            <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
            <p>
              Renowned physicist whose 1939 letter to President Roosevelt helped
              initiate the U.S. atomic bomb program.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
              Though not directly involved in the Manhattan Project, Einstein’s
              warning that Nazi Germany might build a bomb first pushed U.S.
              leadership to act. He later became a strong advocate for nuclear
              disarmament.

            <p>
              Soviet leader who signed the INF Treaty with Reagan, reducing Cold
              War nuclear tensions.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
              Gorbachev played a pivotal role in de-escalating the arms race.
              His reforms and openness to negotiation led to landmark agreements
              that reduced nuclear weapons on both sides.

              Oppenheimer oversaw the creation of the first atomic weapons.
              After the war, he became an advocate for arms control, famously
              saying, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”

              Truman made the decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan in
              an effort to end World War II. His choice marked the beginning of
              the nuclear age and remains one of history’s most controversial
              decisions.

            <p>
              Soviet Premier during the Cuban Missile Crisis, responsible for
              placing missiles in Cuba.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
              Khrushchev’s bold move to install nuclear weapons in Cuba brought
              the world to the brink of war. He ultimately agreed to withdraw
              the missiles in exchange for U.S. concessions, helping avoid
              nuclear conflict.
